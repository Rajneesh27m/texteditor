## Usage Instructions

    -   Click on File > Open.
    -   A file dialog will appear. Select the text file (.txt) you want to open.
    -   The content of the file will be loaded into the text area.
    -   The title bar will update to show the path of the opened file.

3.  Saving a File:
    -   Click on File > Save.
    -   A file dialog will appear. Choose a location, enter a file name, and click "Save".
    -   The file will be saved with a .txt extension.

    -   A message box will confirm that the file has been saved successfully.

4.  Editing Text:
    -   Type, delete, copy, paste, and modify the text directly in the text area.
    -   Use Ctrl+Z (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Z (macOS) to undo actions.
    -   Use Ctrl+Y (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Y (macOS) to redo actions.

5.  Exiting the Application:

## Potential Improvements

-   Find and Replace: Add functionality to search for and replace text within the document.
-   Font Customization: Allow users to change the font style, size, and color.
-   Syntax Highlighting: Implement syntax highlighting for different programming languages.
-   Line Numbers: Display line numbers along the side of the text area.
-   Status Bar: Show information like cursor position, word count, etc., in a status bar.
